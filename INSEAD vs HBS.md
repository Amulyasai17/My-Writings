First of all, studying abroad will give you the international experience that employers crave for. INSEAD and HBS both are in Top five best business schools worldwide.  It is very tough to decide between two best schools. Both schools have its pros and cons. Let us understand the concept of each school first and so that we can decide - where do we fit in. 

 

Institut Européen d'Administration des Affaires - INSEAD:  

INSEAD, the business school was found in the year 1957 by venture capitalist Georges Doriot (the "father of venture capitalism") along with Claude Janssen and Olivier Giscard d'Estaing., with campuses in France, Singapore and UAE (United Arab Emirates). 

One of the top business schools in the world continuously ranking 1st in the year 2017, 2nd in 2018 and 3rd in the years 2019 and 2020. 

INSEAD provides 10 months MBA program with 75 plus electives. 

INSEAD is relatively cheaper when coming to expenses € 82,000 (₹ 65 lakhs) hence it saves both time and money. 

INSEAD outshines in global level because it has trans-continental network and multiple campuses. 

INSEAD is not known in USA, but due to multiple campuses across Europe and Asia, it will provide its students an opportunity to build networks in a particular region via campus selection and exchange program allows students to spend at least one period on another INSEAD campus or partner universities (Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, Kellogg School of Management – Northwestern University, Illinois, and CEIBS - China Europe International Business School, Shanghai). 

 

 

 

 

Harvard Business School (HBS): 

HBS founded in 1908, located in Boston, Massachusetts. 

Ranked in top 5 business schools worldwide ranked 2nd in 2017, 4th in 2018, 5th in 2019 and 2020. 

HBS provides 2 years full time MBA program with exciting courses and general management. 

When coming to expenses HBS costs around $146,880 (₹1 crore). 

Provides opportunity to grow exponentially and explosively mainly in America. 

HBS being based in USA, it houses mainly American students. 

When coming to Brand, HBS is a brand for itself ‘Different League’ and it cannot be compared or underestimated. HBS has vast alumni network in America and worldwide. 

 

Coming to Compensation - Do HBS individuals make more money post Master's degree in Business Administration - The ground is that MBAs tend to be more valuable for American companies and progressively more Asian companies. American and Asian companies pay more. European companies may have better benefits, but European companies do not have better compensation when compared to their American top tier counterparts.  

Fortune 500 CEOS – Harvard Business School has more CEOs that come out of it than any other school. To begin with the reason why people go for MBA, and if we surmise that is salary or a better title in a company, then students from HBS get paid much higher compared to INSEAD. The reason because HBS is located in America where MBA’s requirement is much more than France where INSEAD is located.  

 

Here one should remember that there are key questions to ask yourself: 

Where do anyone want to live both short term and long term?  

Where do one should plan on establishing one’s career? 

One should know whether interested in a truly international feel, or more of an American experience? 

So, if your ultimate goal is to settle in the USA, Harvard Business School undoubtedly proves to a better option. However, if that’s not the case and you’d prefer more exposure and diversity, INSEAD is the way to go. While it is imperative to consider the pros and cons of each institution before taking a final call, it’s safe to say that you cannot go wrong with either of them.
